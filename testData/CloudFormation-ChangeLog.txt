Document History

The following table describes the important changes to the documentation 
since the last release of AWS CloudFormation.

    * API Version: 2010-05-15

    * Latest documentation update: December 30, 2013

Change 	Description 	Release Date

Auto Scaling update

You can specify an instance ID for an Auto Scaling group or launch 
configuration. You can also specify additional Auto Scaling block device 
properties. For more information, see AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup 
or AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration.

December 30, 2013

Amazon SQS update

You can update Amazon SQS queues and specify additional properties. For 
more information, see AWS::SQS::Queue.

December 30, 2013

Limit increases

You can specify up to 60 parameters and 60 outputs in your AWS 
CloudFormation templates

December 30, 2013

New console

The new AWS CloudFormation console
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/> adds features like 
auto-refreshing stack events and alphabetical ordering of stack parameters.

December 19, 2013

Cross-zone load balancing

With cross-zone load balancing, you can route traffic to back-end instances 
across all Avalibility Zones. For more information, see 
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer.

December 19, 2013

AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment tiers

You can specify whether AWS Elastic Beanstalk provisions resources to 
support a web server or to handle background-processing tasks. For more 
information, see AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::Environment.

December 19, 2013

Resource names

You can assign names (physical IDs) to the following resources:

    * ElastiCache Clusters

    * Elastic Load Balancing load balancers

    * Amazon Relational Database Service DB instances

For more information, see Name Type.

December 19, 2013

VPN support

You can enable a virtual private gateway (VGW) to propagate routes to the 
routing tables of a VPC. For more information, see 
AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation.

November 22, 2013

Conditionally create resources and assign properties

Using input parameters, you can control the creation and settings of 
designated stack resources by defining conditions in your AWS 
CloudFormation templates. For example, you can use conditions to create 
stack resources for a production environment. Using the same template, you 
can create similar stack resources with lower capacity for a test 
environment. For more information, see Condition Functions.

November 08, 2013

Prevent accidental updates to stack resources

You can prevent stack updates that might result in unintentional changes to 
stack resources. For example, if you have a stack with a database layer 
that should rarely be updated, you can set a stack policy that prevents 
most users from updating that database layer. For more information, see 
Prevent Updates to Stack Resources.

November 08, 2013

Name resources

Instead of using AWS CloudFormation-generated physical IDs, you can assign 
names to certain resources. The following AWS CloudFormation resources 
support naming:

    * Amazon CloudWatch alarms

    * Amazon DynamoDB tables

    * AWS Elastic Beanstalk applications and environments

    * Amazon S3 buckets

    * Amazon SNS topics

    * Amazon SQS queues

For more information, see Name Type.

November 08, 2013

Assign custom resource types

In your templates, you can specify your own resource type for AWS 
CloudFormation custom resources (AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource). By 
using your own custom resource type name, you can quickly identify the type 
of custom resources that you have in your stack. For example, you can 
specify "Type": "Custom::MyCustomResource". For more information, see 
AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource.

November 08, 2013

Add pseudo parameter

You can now refer to the AWS AccountID inside AWS CloudFormation templates 
by referring to the AWS::AccountID pseudo parameter. For more information, 
see Pseudo Parameters Reference.

November 08, 2013

Specify stacks in IAM policies

You can allow or deny IAM users, groups, or roles to operate on specific 
AWS CloudFormation stacks. For example, you can deny the delete stack 
action on a specific stack ID. For more information, see Controlling Access 
with AWS Identity and Access Management.

November 08, 2013

Federation support

AWS CloudFormation supports temporary security credentials from IAM roles, 
which enable scenarios such as federation and single sign-on to the AWS 
Management Console. You can also make calls to AWS CloudFormation from 
Amazon EC2 instances without embedding long-term security credentials by 
using IAM roles. For more information about AWS CloudFormation and IAM, see 
Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management.

October 14, 2013

Amazon RDS read replica support

You can now create Amazon RDS read replicas from a source DB instance. For 
more information, see the SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property in the 
AWS::RDS::DBInstance resource.

September 24, 2013

Associate public IP address with instances in Auto Scaling group.

You can now associate public IP addresses with instances in an Auto Scaling 
group. For more information, see AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration.

September 19, 2013

Additional VPC support.

AWS CloudFormation added several enhancements to support VPC and VPN 
functionality:

    * You can associate a public IP address and multiple private IP
      addresses to Amazon EC2 network interfaces. For more information, see 
      AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface. You can also associate a primary private
      IP address to an elastic IP address (EIP).

    * You can enable DNS support and specify DNS host names. For more
      information, see AWS::EC2::VPC.

    * You can specify a static route between a virtual private gateway to
      your VPN gateway. For more information, see 
      AWS::EC2::VPNConnectionRoute.

September 17, 2013

Redis and VPC security groups support for Amazon ElastiCache.

You can now specify Redis as the cache engine for an ElastiCache cluster. 
You can also now assign VPC security groups to ElastiCache clusters. For 
more information, see AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster.

September 3, 2013

Parallel stack creation, update and deletion, and nested stack updates.

CloudFormation now creates, updates, and deletes resources in parallel, 
improving the operations' performance. If you update a top-level template, 
CloudFormation automatically updates any nested stacks that have changed. 
For more information, see AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates.

August 12, 2013

VPC security groups can now be set in AWS RDS instances

You can now assign VPC security groups to an Amazon RDS instance with AWS 
CloudFormation. For more information, see the VPCSecurityGroups property in 
AWS::RDS::DBInstance.

February 28, 2013

Rolling Deployments for Auto Scaling Groups

AWS CloudFormation now supports update policies on autoscaling groups, 
which describe how instances in the autoscaling group are replaced or 
modified when the auto scaling group adds or removes instances. You can 
modify these settings at stack creation or during a stack update.

For more information and an example, see UpdatePolicy.

February 20, 2013

Cancel and Rollback Action for Stack Updates

AWS CloudFormation supports the ability to cancel a stack update. The stack 
must be in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state when the update request is made. 
More information is available in the following topics:

    * Canceling a Stack Update

    * aws cloudformation cancel-update-stack
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/cancel-update-stack.html>

    * CancelUpdateStack
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html> 
      in the AWS CloudFormation API Reference

February 20, 2013

EBS-Optimized Instances for Auto Scaling Groups

You can now provision EBS-optimized instances in auto scaling groups for 
dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS in autoscaled instances. The 
implementation is similar to that of the previously released support for 
optimized EBS EC2 instances.

For more information, see the new EbsOptimized property in 
AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration.

February 20, 2013

New Documentation

AWS::EC2::Instance now provides a BlockDeviceMappings property to allow you 
to set block device mappings for your EC2 instance.

With this change, two new types have been added:

    * EC2 Block Device Mapping
    * EC2 EBS Block Device

December 21, 2012

New Documentation

New sections have been added to describe the procedures for creating and 
viewing stacks using the recently redesigned AWS Management Console. You 
can find them here:

    * Creating a Stack
    * Viewing Stack Data and Resources

December 21, 2012

New Documentation

Custom resources are special AWS CloudFormation resources that provide a 
way for a template developer to include resources in an AWS CloudFormation 
stack that are provided by a source other than Amazon Web Services. The 
custom resource provider can be either a template developer or a separate 
third-party resource provider.

Information about custom resources is provided in the following topics:

    * AWS CloudFormation Custom Resource Walkthrough

    * AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource

    * Custom Resource Reference

November 15, 2012

Updated Documentation

AWS CloudFormation now supports specifying provisioned I/O operations per 
second (IOPS) for Amazon RDS instances. You can set this value from 
1000–10,000 in 1000 IOPS increments by using the new Iops property in 
AWS::RDS::DBInstance.

For more information about specifying IOPS for RDS instances, see 
Provisioned IOPS
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/RDSFAQ.PIOPS.html> 
in the Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.

November 15, 2012

New and Updated Documentation

Reorganization of topics to more clearly provide specific information about 
using the AWS Management Console and using the AWS CloudFormation 
command-line interface (CLI).

Information about tagging AWS CloudFormation stacks has been added to the 
documentation, including new guides and updated reference topics:

    * New topic in Using the Console: Setting Stack Options.

New Feature

AWS CloudFormation now provides full support for Virtual Private Cloud 
(VPC) security with Amazon EC2. You can now create and populate an entire 
VPC with every type of VPC resource (subnets, gateways, network ACLs, route 
tables, and so forth) using a single AWS CloudFormation template.

Templates can be downloaded that demonstrate new VPC features:

Single instance in a single subnet
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/vpc_single_instance_in_subnet.template>
Multiple subnets with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and an auto scaling 
group
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/vpc_multiple_subnets.template>

Documentation for the following resource types has been updated:

AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupEgress
AWS::EC2::Instance
AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
AWS::EC2::EIP
AWS::EC2::EIPAssociation
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer

New resource types have been added to the documentation:

AWS::EC2::VPC
AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
AWS::EC2::DHCPOptions
AWS::EC2::DHCPOptions
AWS::EC2::RouteTable
AWS::EC2::NetworkAcl
AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry
AWS::EC2::Subnet
AWS::EC2::VPNGateway
AWS::EC2::CustomerGateway

New Feature

AWS CloudFormation now allows you to add or remove elements from a stack 
when updating it. AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates has been updated, and a 
new section has been added to the walkthrough: Change the Stack's Resources
, which describes how to add and remove resources when updating the stack.

The reference topics: ElasticBeanstalk ConfigurationTemplate, and 
ElasticBeanstalk OptionSettings Property Type, have been significantly 
updated in response to developer requests for more information.

New Feature

AWS CloudFormation now provides support for resources in an existing Amazon 
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). With this release, you can:

    * Launch an EC2 Dedicated Instance into an existing VPC. For more
      information, see AWS::EC2::Instance.

    * Set the SourceDestCheck attribute of an Amazon EC2 instance that
      resides in an existing VPC. For more information, see 
      AWS::EC2::Instance

    * Create Amazon Elastic IP Addresses in an existing VPC. For more
      information, see AWS::EC2::EIP

    * Use CloudFormation to create VPC security groups and ingress/egress
      rules in an existing VPC. For more information, see 
      AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup.

    * Associate an Auto Scaling Group with an existing Amazon VPC by
      setting the VPCZoneIdentifier property of your
      AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup resource. For more information,
      see AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup.

    * Attach an Elastic Load Balancing LoadBalancer to a VPC subnet and
      create security groups for the LoadBalancer. For more information,
      see AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer.

    * Create an RDS instance in an existing VPC. For more information, see 
      AWS::RDS::DBInstance.
